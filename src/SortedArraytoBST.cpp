/*
Given a Sorted Array of integers .Create a new Balanced Binary Search Tree from the Array
and return the head of the new BST .

Ex : Input : [1,6,10]
Output : A new BST which structure is as follows 
  6
 / \
1  10

A BST is said to be balanced ,when it satisifes the following property 

Every node's Difference of Left subtree height and right-subtree height is not more than 1 .

Below Tree is Not a Balanced BST ,as 1's left subtree has height of 0 ,but 
right subtree height is 2 
(Diff >1)

  1
   \
    3
   / \
  10  5

Note : Return head of newly created BST
Note : Return Null for invalid Inputs
Note : Donot create a new BST .
